# Authentication

`Authentication` is a means of indicating that a message can be tied to the creator, 
                 so the recipient can verify that only the creator could have sent the message. 
`Non-Repudiation` is a means of preventing the sender of a message from claiming that they did not send the message.

An asymmetric key used as a signing key offers non-repudiation.
