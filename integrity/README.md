# Integrity

`Integrity` is an indication that a message has not been altered during storage or transmission.

A secure hash algorithm is used to provide integrity. It can be combined with a
shared-secret signing key in an HMAC algorithm to ensure authentication. 
A nonce provides anti-replay protection.
